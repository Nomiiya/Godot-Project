# Godot-Project
This contains some trials and other things that I do to learn how to create games, specifically in Godot.

# Light and Dark
This was made with around 5 hours that I had free over the weekend. This was to learn about the light occlussion and tilesets in Godot.
It was pretty fun and i'm really curious about how I can add this to my main project.
